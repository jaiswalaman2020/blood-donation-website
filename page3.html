          “I love donating blood. It’s so simple, and it does so much.” – Aman
          Jaiswal
        </p>
        <p>
          “I donate because I want people to have access to the blood they need
          when they most need it. I am thankful that I can be part of helping
          during a time of need.” – Raj sekher
        </p>
        <p>
          “Perhaps the greatest reward from donating blood is knowing your
          blood, part of who you are, lives on in those around you. So, for
          those who are thinking of donating, understand you would truly be
          offering the most beautiful part of yourself for the benefit of those
          less fortunate.” – Sahil kumar
        </p>
        <p>
          "I love people! I’m the kind of person who drops everything for people
          in need, and donating blood every chance I get is my favorite way to
          help others. It’s simple, it doesn’t cause me any inconvenience, and I
          have a sure way of knowing that my donation makes a difference.” –
          Devesh Tripathi
        </p>
        <p>
          “I encourage everyone who is physically capable to be a regular donor.

          would promote for everyone.” - shalvia Nawal
